## Top Movies CLI Flatiron Portfolio Project

The first portfolio project that is due for the first module when participating in the Flatiron School's Software Engineering
program is building a command line interface Ruby gem that scrapes data from a webpage and allows any user to interact with
that data in some way. I decided to create a gem that would allow any user to see the top grossing movies of all time. This gem
would scrape data from the Rotten Tomatoes webpage where they have a list of 50 movies in order starting from the #1 top grossing
movie and working its way down. 

When I first started this project, I had a small idea of where to start, so what I did was first look for a website that my gem
was to scrape data from and after about 10-15 minutes of searching, I came across the Rotten Tomatoes webpage, which is where
my gem scrapes from. I played around with the website for a while, finding the data I needed and how I was going to go about
getting that data and displaying it in a nice, organized manner to the user. When it comes to working on any project, I have learned
that just playing around with code can go a long way. I probably spent a good, 4-5 hours just messing with the Nokogiri and 
Open-URI modules to scrape different data from the website, then another couple of hours iterating through that data to display
it how I wanted it to be layed out to the user. 

Next, was actually starting to build the project and this was where I was stumped because I had never actually built my own Ruby
gem and had no idea where to start. Thankfully, Flatiron provides some very helpful resources that allowed me to get a small
blueprint (or, rough draft) of my project formed. This blueprint consisted of hardcoding some of the data, but it was to get my
project off the ground and into the air. I knew that later down the road major changes were going to be made, but I felt much
better than before knowing that I at least had a baby project started.
