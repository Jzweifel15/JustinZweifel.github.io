As of Tuesday, June 23rd of 20202, I have officially completed my first portfolio project for the part-time online software engineering program at Flatiron. 
We were required to build a ruby gem that allowed any user to interact with an interface of data using the command line. This data had to come from a webpage of 
our choice, but we were not allowed to hardcode this data. We had to either scrape this data from the website or request this data from the websites API. For my
project, I decided to scrape my data. 

My project, called Top_Movies_Cli scrapes data from the Rotten Tomatoes webpage on the top 50 highest grossing (most money made) movies of all time, turns each. 
movie into a Movie object using some corresponding information that can be found for each movie on the webpage, like the movie's title, value, release date, and 
a description of the movie. Anyone who uses this gem will have access to seeing the list of movies and can interact with this data by choosing and typing a number
one through fifty to select a movie, which the gem will spit back out the corresponding information for that movie. 

Although my project is plain and simple, and the project does not do very much, I am still very proud of my project. It was a giant headache in the making, but it
always feels so good when it finally works and does what you're expecting of it to do. Hopefully, this small little project is just the first step to something
much, much bigger in the future.
