One thing I definitely struggled with during the first mile was iterations. I don't know why, but it was just one of those 
concepts that was harder for me to grasp. And, I wouldn't say it was all iterations, but specifically iterating through a 
hash was my issue. If you had me read a code snippet that involved iterating through an array, I would have no problem 
telling you what the output would be, but if you gave me a code snippet that involved iterating through a hash, then you 
would have to give me a few minutes of me thinking out loud and sounding like Gollum from lord of the rings before you get 
an answer from me. Currently, I understand iterations much better. I spent a lot of time going back, re-reading the previous 
lessons on iterations, and I watched some video tutorials on youtube. Overall, I still wouldn't say I'm an expert, but I feel 
more confident on knowing when to iterate and how to iterate.
