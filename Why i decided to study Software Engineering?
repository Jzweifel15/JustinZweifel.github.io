# Why I Decided to Study Software Engineering

- I took a few computer classes back in high school and learned how much potential there is in the world of software, 
and how crucial it is to our every day lives. We use software for [almost] everything. 

- One of my teachers really inspired me into wanting to further my knowledge with coding and computer science after taking a programming course utilizing 
flowcharts, pseudocode, and Python to create small programs. I went to a small trade school my last few years of high school 
where I learned some of the fundamentals of programming and databasing with Java and MySQL. Then, once I graduated high school,
I decided I wanted to further my education by going to college and get a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. During my two 
years, I experimented with web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (since we didn't touch web development in high 
school) and decided that web development was the route I wanted to take with my software engineering career. However, my 
college has me taking all of these prerequisite classes before I can even start taking any courses for my major, that I 
finally realized that it was pointless because why would anyone want to learn about the Pythagorean theorem when building a 
website (unless I'm missing something here?). 

- I inspire to one day get to work on a project with my own team that will have a 
great impact on the world of software. I don't have to lead this team, just to get to work with other creative, inspiring 
minds who have the same passion as I do is what I look forward to the most after studying Software Engineering through 
Flatiron Schools.
